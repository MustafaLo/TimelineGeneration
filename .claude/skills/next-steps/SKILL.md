description: Guidelines for including next steps on what user should do while Claude Code is working on next features to make sure user doesn't stay idle and can be productive on other steps
---

Before working on ANY new feature (changing / adding new files or code), always:
1. Include an estimated time on how long the feature will take to add. If the user hasn't instructed on adding a new feature and is only asking for a response or plan from you -- skip this. Otherwise include an estimated time on how long the task will take
2. Give a series of next steps that the user could complete while Claude Code works. These next steps could take the form of anything whether that is researching another aspect of the project, thinking about a specific new feature, reviewing some code or past changes, etc. The point of this is to make sure the user does not stay idle while working. The steps should also reasonably correlate to how long the estimated time to completion is for the task

Keep these steps actionable and engaging for the user.
